# Getting started as a JaCaMo developer

The [JaCaMo project](https://github.com/jacamo-lang/jacamo) aims to promote the Multi-Agent Oriented Programming (MAOP) approach by providing a suitable integration of tools and languages for programming the following dimensions: agents ([Jason](https://github.com/jason-lang/jason)), environment ([CArtAgO](https://github.com/cartago-lang/cartago)), and organisation ([Moise](https://github.com/moise-lang/moise)).

The available documentation is [currently on GitHub](https://github.com/jacamo-lang/jacamo/blob/master/doc/readme.adoc).
